## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start Local Dev Infrastructure

This launches Postgres, Redis (optional), and mounts `schema.sql` into the container.

task dev_infra

text

> **Note:**  
> Make sure `schema.sql` exists under `infra/dev/schema.sql` if you're using Docker volume mounting.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the User Service

task run:user_service


Or directly:
```bash
go run ./cmd/user_service/main.go
```


---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Protobuf Code

This will generate Go code from your `.proto` files for gRPC services:

task gen:protobuf


Make sure you have the necessary tools installed:

```bash

go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```
---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Tests and Generate Coverage

task test

text

This generates:
- `coverage.out` ‚Äî raw test coverage file
- `coverage.html` ‚Äî annotated HTML coverage report

## üîó Useful Commands

- **Start All Services**:  
  `docker-compose up -d`

- **Clean Containers/Volumes**:  
  `docker-compose down -v`
